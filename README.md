## Problems & Challenges
- Problem 6: Strings that start with 10. I was missing a loop so it was a quick fix for me.
- Problem 10: Strings that don't contain substring 10. I was able to look through my notes for help.
- Problem 12: Strings with exactly 3 1's. I missed adding the dead state and it worked fine after that.
- Problem 14: Strings with even length. I also had help from class notes for this.
- Problem 20: Strings with 3k+1 1's or odd number of 0's. I struggled a lot for this one and I asked AI to help because I kept getting a test string wrong and AI gave me the proper steps and cleared up confusion. Turned out I just needed to do the opposite for b0 and b1. 

## Gold strings & next steps
I didn't have any surprising results. All my test strings produced the right results. I plan to carefully trace through each transition for boundary cases before running and testing. This helped me understand how empty transitions allow NFA to know what path to take.
